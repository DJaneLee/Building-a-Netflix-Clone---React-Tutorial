# Building Netflix from Scratch Using React (Custom Hooks, Context, Portals), Firebase, Compound & Styled Components

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This application (a Netflix clone) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Styled Components. I have built the following pages within this application: sign in, sign up, browse & lastly the homepage. There are four different pages, some using protected routes with auth listeners. Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.

  - React (custom hooks, context, portals)
  - Firebase (Firestore/auth)
  - Compound & Styled components
